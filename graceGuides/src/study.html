      your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your
      gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh
      day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.</p>

    </p>
    <p><b>1 John 3:1 ESV:</b> See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of
      God;
      and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.</p>
    <p><b>Matthew 5:13-17 ESV:</b> You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its
      saltiness
      be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people’s feet. You are
      the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a
      basket,
      but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so
      that
      they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. For the light of the world is a gift
      from God, and is a token of thanksgiving to God</p>
    <p><b>Ephesians 2:10 NLT:</b> For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the
      good things he planned for us long ago.</p>
